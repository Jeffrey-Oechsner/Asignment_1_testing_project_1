3) Give your thoughts on TDD
1. What was positive and good about using TDD?
- Increased code Quality: TDD makes the developer to write clean and structured code.
-you write tests before implementing code, will result in better designed software
- it gives detailed documentation Tests will explain how the code is supposed to work.
- TDD gave me confidence that my code works as it was intended to work.

2. What was annoying or difficult?
- Refactoring. TDD encourages refactoring, changes to the codebase requires updates to tests.
- mindset you have to have when doing TDD, can be difficult at times. 
- writing some of the tests before code, can feel like its time consuming at first.

3. what surprised you?
- better design: TDD leads to better software design, even though its not immediately. its a great practice to do.

4. Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?
- Yes, TDD encourages thinking about egde cases and potential problems from the start. 
- TDD helps the creation of test cases that might have been overlooked in traditional development. which give robust softare.
